# 🧑‍🦰 Face Recognition with ORL Database 📸

Welcome to the face recognition project using the **ORL face database**! This repository contains Python code that explores face recognition techniques using this dataset, which includes images of 40 people with variations in lighting, expressions, and occlusions.

---

## 🛠️ **Key Functionalities**

### 📂 **Data Loading**  
- Loads the ORL face dataset containing images of 40 different people, each with multiple variations.
- Reshapes data from **column-major order** to **row-major order** for better handling in the recognition process.

### 👀 **Data Visualization**  
- **Show single face:** Displays an individual face image.
- **Show multiple faces:** Visualizes a grid of face images with customizable settings (number of images per row, dimensions of each image).

### 🔄 **Data Partitioning**  
- Splits the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets while ensuring **balanced representation** across classes.
- Will raise an error if the requested number of examples per class exceeds the number of examples in the smallest class.

### 🧑‍🔬 **Face Splitting (Optional)**  
- Splits face images into **left** and **right halves**, useful for face completion tasks (e.g., reconstructing missing facial features).

🧩 **Detailed Functionalities**
-------------------------------

### **🔄 Data Loading: `load_data` function**

*   Loads the ORL dataset from a `.mat` file.
*   Converts data into **row-major order** for easy processing.

### **👁️ Data Visualization: `show_single_face` & `show_faces` functions**

*   **show_single_face**: Displays a single face image.
*   **show_faces**: Shows a grid of multiple face images with options to customize the number of images per row and image dimensions.

### **🔀 Data Partitioning: `partition_data` function**

*   Splits the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets while maintaining a balanced class distribution.
*   Raises an error if the requested number of examples per class exceeds the smallest available class size.

### **✂️ Face Splitting (Optional): `split_left_right` & `join_left_right` functions**

*   **split_left_right**: Splits face images into **left** and **right halves**, enabling tasks like face completion.
*   **join_left_right**: Rejoins split halves back into a complete image.

🧑‍🔬 **Face Completion (Optional)**
------------------------------------

While face completion is not explicitly implemented in the provided code, the `split_left_right` function allows you to explore this task. Face completion involves predicting missing facial features (e.g., the right side of a face given the left side).

### Potential Face Completion Approach:

1.  Split training data into left and right halves using `split_left_right`.
2.  Train a machine learning model (e.g., **linear regression**) to predict the right half of a face from the left half.
3.  Use the trained model to predict missing facial features for unseen images during testing.
4.  Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.

🔧 **Further Improvements**
---------------------------

*   **🔎 Face Recognition Algorithms**  
    Implement algorithms like **Eigenfaces** or **Fisherfaces** to recognize faces from the dataset.
    
*   **🤖 Advanced Face Completion Techniques**  
    Explore **deep learning models** such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for more robust face completion.
    
*   **💡 Evaluate Robustness**  
    Investigate how well face recognition and completion models perform with variations in **lighting**, **expressions**, and **occlusions**.
