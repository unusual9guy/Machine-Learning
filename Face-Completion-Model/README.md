# Face Recognition with ORL Database

This repository contains Python code for exploring face recognition techniques using the ORL face database. The code provides functionalities for:

* **Data Loading:** Loads the ORL face dataset containing images of 40 people with variations in lighting, expressions, and occlusions.
* **Data Visualization:** Visualizes single or multiple face images in a grid format.
* **Data Partitioning:** Splits the dataset into training and testing sets while ensuring balanced representation from each class.
* **Face Completion (Optional):** Processes face images to split them into left and right halves, enabling potential face completion tasks.

**Project Structure:**

* `lab3lib.py`: Contains helper functions for data loading, visualization, partitioning, and face splitting (optional for face completion).
* `README.md`: This file.
* `Your_script.py` (Replace with your script name): Script implementing face recognition or face completion experiments using the provided functions.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
2. **Run your script:**  
   Execute your Python script to perform face recognition or face completion experiments.

**Key Functionalities:**

- **Data Loading (`load_data` function):**  
  - Loads the ORL face dataset from a `.mat` file.  
  - Reshapes the data from column-major order to row-major order for better handling.

- **Data Visualization (`show_single_face` and `show_faces` functions):**  
  - Displays a single face image or a grid of multiple face images.  
  - Allows customization of the number of images per row and image dimensions.

- **Data Partitioning (`partition_data` function):**  
  - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets while ensuring each class has the same number of examples in both sets.  
  - Raises an error if the requested number of examples per class is greater than the number of examples available in the smallest class.

- **Face Splitting (Optional - `split_left_right` and `join_left_right` functions):**  
  - Splits a face image into its left and right halves (for potential face completion tasks).  
  - Re-joins split halves back into a complete image.

**Face Completion (Optional):**  
While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, the `split_left_right` function enables you to explore face completion tasks. Face completion aims to predict missing facial features based on the available ones. Here's a potential approach:  

1. Split the training data into left and right halves using `split_left_right`.  
2. Train a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) to predict the right half of a face given the left half as input.  
3. Use the trained model to predict the missing right half for unseen face images (during testing).  
4. Evaluate the performance of the face completion model using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

**Further Improvements:**

- Implement face recognition algorithms like Eigenfaces or Fisherfaces using the provided data loading and visualization functions.
- Explore more sophisticated face completion techniques using deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Investigate the robustness of face recognition and completion models to variations in lighting, expressions, and occlusions.

This README provides a basic overview of the functionalities and potential applications. Refer to the code (`lab3lib.py`) and your script for detailed implementation.
