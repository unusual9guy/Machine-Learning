# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects Repository ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This repository houses various machine learning projects.

## ðŸ“‚ **Projects in This Repository**
- **Face Completion Model**: This project focuses on predicting missing parts of face images using machine learning. It utilizes the **ORL face dataset** to experiment with face recognition and completion techniques.

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unusual9guy/Machine-Learning
   cd Face-Completion-Model
   ```
2. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib scipy`
3. Run the project Jupyter notebook: Open the .ipynb file (`Face-Completion - Main.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to begin the project.y

For detailed instructions on each project, refer to the individual README files in their respective directories.
